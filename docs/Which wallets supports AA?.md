### FYI

*Every transaction on the blockchain requires gas, which is a small amount of crypto, to make transactions. Before you begin exploring StarkNet mainnet, you will need to fund your Argent X wallet, so you can deploy your wallet. This is because every wallet on StarkNet is a smart contract (remember AA class) and requires a small on-chain transaction to activate your wallet.*

After that, you're gonna be able to send, swap and add tokens, etc.


### Argent X Features

The Argent X wallet has features that you would expect from a cryptocurrency wallet like global on-ramp or bridge funds. But Argent X is a smart wallet that has unique features made possible by being built on StarkNet. 

* Fraud monitoring.
* Transaction review.
* Batch transactions together.
* Social recovery.
* Session keys.


Now you know, time to explore!
